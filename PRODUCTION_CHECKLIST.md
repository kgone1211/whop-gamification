## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:

1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous deployment
   ```bash
   # Vercel
   vercel rollback
   
   # Docker
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d --no-deps web
   ```

2. **Database**: Restore from backup if needed
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
   ```

3. **Notify users** if service is affected

## Support Contacts

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check deployment status
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/whop

# Test database connection
npx prisma db pull

# View logs (Docker)
docker-compose logs -f web

docker-compose restart web

# Scale workers (if needed)
docker-compose up -d --scale worker=3
```

## Emergency Procedures

### Application Won't Start
1. Check environment variables
2. Verify database connection
3. Check Redis connection
4. Review build logs
5. Check for port conflicts

### Webhooks Failing

2. Review slow query log
3. Check disk space
4. Verify credentials
5. Test failover (if configured)
